components can opt-in to client-side rendering using the component dehydrator.</li> <li>Second works with any React-like library including <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Why build this framework?</h2> <p>While using React to build the <a href="/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">BBC News front page</a> and several other mostly-static applications, a common theme emerged: only a small number of components on these pages require client-side JavaScript to function. Bundling the entire page to render on the client does not provide an optimal experience &#x2014; especially for users on low-powered devices or low-speed connections. Instead, selectively bundling components enables development teams to take advantage of React&#x2019;s event system and stateful components while reducing bundle size and minimizing CPU overhead for client-side rendering.</p> <p>Second is not a large or complex framework. It is the result of combining several simple and well-tested techniques&#x2014;</p> <ul> <li>Server-side rendering</li> <li>Container components for declarative data requirements</li> <li>Selective client-side rendering</li> </ul> <p>&#x2014;and combining them into a single package that can be easily reused across multiple applications.</p> <a href="/introducing-second-a-framework-for-mostly-static-react-applications/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <article class="pb-3"> <span class="f-r c-gl">Apr 4, 2017</span> <h3> <a href="/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">Introducing a faster BBC News front page</a> </h3> <p></p><p>Web performance is something I care deeply about both as a developer whose work affects millions of people around the world, and as a user who often accesses the web on slow &amp; unreliable connections.

The <a href="http://careerssearch.bbc.co.uk/">BBC Careers website</a> typically has over 100 vacancies posted on any given day. Before I joined the BBC, I found the sheer scale of it a bit intimidating. Usually I can get an idea of what it&#x2019;s like to work for a company by reading their job advertisements and their engineering blogs, but with the BBC I was almost completely clueless. In this post I hope to shed some light on what it&#x2019;s like to work as a developer or tester for BBC News.</p> <p>Just a small disclaimer first: from an engineering perspective, the BBC is not like most other companies &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more like dozens of smaller companies, each with their own engineering department, working towards a common goal. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news">News</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport">Sport</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes">Programmes</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio">Radio</a>&#x2026; As digital products, these are all built mostly independently of each other.

This was in part due to a lack of performance monitoring and 4 years of feature creep, but also due to a lack of performance-oriented culture throughout the business.</p> <p>I created a lightweight prototype of the BBC News core experience which demonstrates that focusing on the content first and foremost can result in an extremely fast page. I want the BBC and other websites to rethink what the core experience means, and experiment with giving users the power to define their own experience.</p> </blockquote> <p></p><p>In the beginning of 2012 the BBC Responsive News team wrote about how they provide a &#x201C;core experience&#x201D; for users by default, and then progressively enhance the page if the browser <a href="http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard">cuts the mustard</a>.

In this post I&#x2019;m going to explain how JavaScript&#x2019;s prototype chain works, and how you can use it to achieve inheritance.</em></p> <p>First, it&#x2019;s important to understand that while JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it is prototype-based and does not implement a traditional class system. Keep in mind that when I mention a&#xA0;<em>class</em> in this post, I am simply referring to JavaScript objects and the prototype chain &#x2013; more on this in a bit.</p> <p>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, which you can think of&#xA0;as sort of like associative arrays - objects contain&#xA0;named properties which can be accessed with&#xA0;<code>obj.propName</code>&#xA0;or&#xA0;<code>obj[&apos;propName&apos;]</code>. Each object has an internal property called&#xA0;<em>prototype</em>, which links to another object. The prototype object has a prototype object of its own, and so on &#x2013;&#xA0;this is referred to as the&#xA0;<em>prototype chain</em>. If you follow an object&#x2019;s prototype chain, you will eventually reach the core&#xA0;<code>Object</code>&#xA0;prototype whose prototype is <code>null</code>, signalling the end of the chain.</p> <a href="/understanding-javascript-inheritance-and-the-prototype-chain/">(Read more)</a><p></p> </article> <div> <a class="btn p-3" href="/page2">&#x2190; Older Posts</a> </div> </section> <footer class="wrap mt-5 pt-4"> <ul class="ls-n f-r"> <li> <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/> </svg> </span> <span>wildlyinaccurate</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/joseph_wynn"> <span class="d-ib va-m w-4 h-4"> <svg viewbox="0 0 16 16"> <path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
