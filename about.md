## Hi there!

My name is Joseph. I'm a rock-climbing, tea-drinking developer working for the BBC in London. I'm hugely passionate about creating an accessible, open, usable web.

You can read more about my work on [my résumé](https://resume.wildlyinaccurate.com/), or visit the [Projects](/projects) page to see what I'm hacking on in my spare time.
