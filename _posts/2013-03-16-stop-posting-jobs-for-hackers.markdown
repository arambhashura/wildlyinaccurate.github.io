I understand what people mean when they say that they want to hire a _hacker_. It means that they want to hire a developer; probably one who is enthusiastic and good at solving problems. The thing is, to me, the term _hacker _is no different from terms like _rock star_ or _ninja_. When I see these terms in a job advertisement, a few red flags are raised in my mind:<!--more-->

#### You're probably a start-up

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it often means that whoever posted the job advertisement has a lack of technical knowledge, which probably also means...

#### You don't actually know what kind of developer you want

_Hacker_, _rock star_, _ninja_ - these don't actually mean anything in the context of programming. Do you want a front-end web developer who can make complex JavaScript apps, or a Ruby developer with a working knowledge in system administration, or do you just want an all-rounder? If the title of your job advertisement has no context, I (and [many other people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1757059)) will simply ignore it.

#### The job requires more than one person

You really need 2 or 3 people for this job, but budgeting concerns have forced you to go for a single super-developer instead. This also leads me to believe that the job will have ill-defined requirements, and that I'm likely to be over-worked and under-paid.

For the most part, I think that if you find yourself posting an ad for a _hacker_, _rock star_, or _ninja_, you should take it as a sign that you need to re-think your hiring requirements. Take a little extra time to figure out what kind of developer you _really_ want to hire, and write the advertisement accordingly.
