<p>I understand what people mean when they say that they want to hire a <em>hacker</em>. It means that they want to hire a developer; probably one who is enthusiastic and good at solving problems. The thing is, to me, the term <em>hacker </em>is no different from terms like <em>rock star</em> or <em>ninja</em>. When I see these terms in a job advertisement, a few red flags are raised in my mind:</p>
<h4>You're probably a start-up</h4>
<p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it often means that whoever posted the job advertisement has a lack of technical knowledge, which probably also means...</p>
<h4>You don't actually know what kind of developer you want</h4>
<p><em>Hacker</em>, <em>rock star</em>, <em>ninja</em> - these don't actually mean anything in the context of programming. Do you want a front-end web developer who can make complex JavaScript apps, or a Ruby developer with a working knowledge in system administration, or do you just want an all-rounder? If the title of your job advertisement has no context, I (and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1757059">many other people</a>) will simply ignore it.</p>
<h4>The job requires more than one person</h4>
<p>You really need 2 or 3 people for this job, but budgeting concerns have forced you to go for a single super-developer instead. This also leads me to believe that the job will have ill-defined requirements, and that I'm likely to be over-worked and under-paid.</p>
<p>For the most part, I think that if you find yourself posting an ad for a <em>hacker</em>, <em>rock star</em>, or <em>ninja</em>, you should take it as a sign that you need to re-think your hiring requirements. Take a little extra time to figure out what kind of developer you <em>really</em> want to hire, and write the advertisement accordingly.</p>
