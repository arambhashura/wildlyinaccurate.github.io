<p>There are <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts">plenty</a> <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">of</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1058946">discussions</a> about which font is the best for programming. The problem is, there are so many "best" fonts that it's difficult to choose one. Rather than have an exhaustive list of "best" fonts for programming, wouldn't it be easier to simply know which fonts to avoid?</p>
<h2>Brush Script MT</h2>
<p>This font was created in 1942 by Robert E. Smith. It's designed to look like the characters have been handwritten with an ink brush. This font will make you feel right at home if you grew up writing your code with an ink brush. Otherwise, don't use it.</p>

<h2>Chiller</h2>
<p>A relatively modern font (1995), Chiller is supposed to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/chiller/">very legible</a> even at small sizes. This font is great for giving your code that "spooky" feel. However if you prefer emotionless, monospaced fonts, Chiller is probably not for you.</p>

<h2>Comic Sans MS</h2>
<p>By far the most loved font on the web, Comic Sans has been bringing joy to peoples' lives since its inception in 1994. Coding in Comic Sans is fun, and reading code in Comic Sans is even funner-er. Unfortunately, <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/">some</a> <a href="http://www.comicsanscriminal.com/">people</a> don't like Comic Sans, so you should avoid using it unless you enjoy being ridiculed by your colleagues.</p>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Created in the Swinging Sixties by a fellow named Geoffrey Lee, Impact was intended for headlines. Why should headlines be the only text with emphasis, though? Using Impact will give your code the emphasis it deserves by making every single line a headline. The downside is that prolonged exposure to Impact can cause developers to read everything in a yelling voice. If this is a problem for you, avoid using this font.</p>
