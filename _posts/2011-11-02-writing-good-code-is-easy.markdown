Everybody wants to write "good code", right? So why is it that nearly every time we pick up another developer's work, our [WTF-o-meter](http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m) goes crazy?

Everybody has a different idea of what "good code" is. Below are a few ways that I believe we can increase the quality of our code and reduce the number of WTFs our code generates.

*   Keep it simple; refactor overly-complex methods...
*   ...Or if refactoring isn't feasible, document complex methods.
*   Use [descriptive variable and method names](http://xunitpatterns.com/Intent%20Revealing%20Name.html).
*   Follow code conventions.
*   Don't commit unfinished or broken code.

Most of these are just common sense. The trouble is, we throw good coding practices – and common sense – out the window when we're under pressure from things like slipping deadlines and scope creep. If you ever find this happening, just remember to** write your code as if the person who has to maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. **What would you rather: miss a deadline, or be hacked up into little pieces by an angry developer?
