<p>Everybody wants to write "good code", right? So why is it that nearly every time we pick up another developer's work, our <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTF-o-meter</a> goes crazy?</p>
<p><a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wtfm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-311" title="The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute" src="assets/wtfm.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>Everybody has a different idea of what "good code" is. Below are a few ways that I believe we can increase the quality of our code and reduce the number of WTFs our code generates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it simple; refactor overly-complex methods...</li>
<li>...Or if refactoring isn't feasible, document complex methods.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Intent%20Revealing%20Name.html">descriptive variable and method names</a>.</li>
<li>Follow code conventions.</li>
<li>Don't commit unfinished or broken code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these are just common sense. The trouble is, we throw good coding practices – and common sense – out the window when we're under pressure from things like slipping deadlines and scope creep. If you ever find this happening, just remember to<strong> write your code as if the person who has to maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. </strong>What would you rather: miss a deadline, or be hacked up into little pieces by an angry developer?</p>
