<p>Coming from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> (a full-featured IDE), I felt that Sublime Text was missing a few useful features. Luckily, one of the great things about Sublime is that it can be easily extended with <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/plugins.html">plugins</a> and packages. Perhaps the most useful package for Sublime is <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Sublime Package Control</a>, which allows you to easily install and manage packages (it can even uninstall itself - über meta).</p>
<p>Below are some Sublime Text packages that I have found to be useful for web development.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete"><strong>All Autocomplete</strong></a> extends the Sublime Text autocompletion to find matches in all open files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colinta/ApacheConf.tmLanguage"><strong>ApacheConf.tmLanguage</strong></a> provides ApacheConf syntax highlighting (for .htaccess, vhosts, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs"><strong>DocBlockr</strong></a> simplifies and automates writing DocBlock comments in many languages including PHP and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle"><strong>Sass</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime"><strong>LESS</strong></a> both provide syntax highlighting for the Sass and LESS dynamic stylesheet languages. <strong><a href="https://github.com/WhatWeDo/Sublime-Text-2-Compass-Build-System">Compass</a> </strong>also provides a watch/build system for Sass.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements"><strong>SideBarEnhancements</strong></a> provides many useful enhancements to the default Sublime Text sidebar, including <em>Copy Path</em> and <em>Open With...</em><em></em></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel">SublimeCodeIntel</a></strong> is a full-featured code intelligence engine that provides smart autocomplete and jump-to-symbol functionality.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter">SublimeLinter</a></strong> automatically runs your code through a linter and highlights lines that it deems to contain (potential) errors. SublimeLinter has built-in linters for most popular languages.</li>
</ul>
