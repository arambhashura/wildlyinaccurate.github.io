Setting up your editor correctly can make working with other developers much less painful. Below are some things that I believe every developer should do when editing source code. Any good IDE or editor should have settings to do these things automatically - the points below are paired with their Sublime Text setting.

*   Trim trailing whitespace - `"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true`
*   Always use Unix line endings (LF) -Â `"default_line_ending": "unix"`
*   Ensure files end with a new line - `"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true`
*   Automatically detect indentation style - `"detect_indentation": true`
*   Or, failing the above, have a way to quickly switch between indentation styles.
