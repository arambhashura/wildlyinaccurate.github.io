<p>Setting up your editor correctly can make working with other developers much less painful. Below are some things that I believe every developer should do when editing source code. Any good IDE or editor should have settings to do these things automatically - the points below are paired with their Sublime Text setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim trailing whitespace - <code>"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true</code></li>
<li>Always use Unix line endings (LF) -Â <code>"default_line_ending": "unix"</code></li>
<li>Ensure files end with a new line - <code>"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true</code></li>
<li>Automatically detect indentation style - <code>"detect_indentation": true</code></li>
<li>Or, failing the above, have a way to quickly switch between indentation styles.</li>
</ul>
